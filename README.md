[ Are you young and interested in internet governance, innovation, new technologies and public policies? And did you know that many countries are creating strategic plans to foster the development of Artificial Intelligence? We want to understand the possible socio-economic impacts of this new technology in Latin America and if we also need a strategy to deal with the new transformations that are to come. 
This is a project to investigate how to develop Artificial Intelligence in Latin America, with a view to improving our reality and not worsening it.
